TODO(yjbanov): Do not require checking in generated test clients when
               https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=5187 is fixed.

This package contains tests that test the correctness of the client API
generator. Tests are organized into triplets of files like this:

NAME_test.json
  Contains a sample JSON Google API discovery document.
NAME_client.dart
  Generated API client from the corresponsing _test.json file.
NAME_test.dart
  A unittest that tests the generated API client.

To generate _client.dart files after you added/edited a _test.json file, run
bin/generate_test_clients.dart. Depending on your source version control system
you may need to make the existing files editable prior to generating test
clients.
